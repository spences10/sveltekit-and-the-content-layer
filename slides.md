Hi my name is Scott, I‚Äôm a developer advocate at GraphCMS

GraphCMS is a headless API content management system and, we really pride ourselves on delivering structured content at scale

We‚Äôre one of the first, if not the first headless GraphQL based CMS‚Äô

We're completely GraphQL native to this day, we‚Äôre all in on GraphQL and that‚Äôs all we provide to access content

This will be a brief history of content on the web, where we are now and where we‚Äôre going

These sites were heavily theme based, you could make your own and alter them to your liking

URQL

Or Universal React Query Library is a great GraphQL client with Svelte bindings

An URQL client can be initialised anywhere in the Svelte project

a __layout.svelte component is a good place to have the client as it will be available throughout the project

Kind of like how you would do a content provider in React but with a lot less boilerplate

The __layout.svelte file can be used for persisted components like a navbar and footer

One of my favourite ways to visualise data coming into a svelte component

After the script tag in the body of the page
