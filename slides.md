# SvelteKit and the Content Layer

## Scott Spence

MMT Meetup Nov 2021

</div>

<!--
Hi my name is Scott, I‚Äôm a developer advocate at GraphCMS

GraphCMS is a headless API content management system

We really pride ourselves on delivering structured content at scale

We‚Äôre one of the first, if not the first headless GraphQL based CMS‚Äô

Completely GraphQL native to this day, we‚Äôre all in on GraphQL and that‚Äôs all we provide

This will be a brief history of content on the web, where we are now and where we‚Äôre going

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2" class='place-items-center'>

Traditional CMS<span class='text-[#F5487FFF]'>.</span>

- Website based
- ‚ÄúTheme‚Äù based
- Server rendered
- Tightly coupled
- You pay for everything
- Often slow


</div>

<style>
  p {
    font-size: 3.25rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: left;
  }
  ul {
    list-style: disc !important;
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  ::marker { 
    color: #F5487FFF; 
  }
</style>


<!-- 
So let‚Äôs take a quick look at what a CMS was back in the day

Primarily website based, there wasn‚Äôt the need to have any content piped to a mobile device

These sites were heavily theme based, you could make your own and alter them to your liking

You‚Äôd pay for everything, you were hosting this yourself, there wasn‚Äôt really CDNs back then and server space was expensive

A lot of the things which made it slow were those round trips to the page from the database

Headless CMS<span class='text-[#F5487FFF]'>.</span>

- Frontend agnostic
- Mostly CRUD
- Decoupled
- Developer flexibility
- CI/CD with Git

<!-- 
This brings us to headless...

So what is a headless CMS

Give developers a lot of flexibility to implement what why like
